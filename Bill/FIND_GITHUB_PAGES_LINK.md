## ⏱️ Important Notes

### If Link Doesn't Show Yet:
1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** - GitHub needs time to build your site
2. **Refresh the Settings page** - Press F5
3. **Check the Pages section** - Look for green checkmark or "Your site is live at..."

### If You See "Your site is ready to be published":

- Click **Save** again
